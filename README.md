## Stay Focussed

Stay Focussed is a chrome extension (or plugin) to keep you focussed on the task at hand. 

Many of us get distracted while working on a focussed task and unconsciously open a new tab in Chrome and visit a distracting website. Once the page loads, our attention is completely hijacked and the focus is lost. This plugin's goal is to break the cycle of distraction and redirect you back to your task at hand.

You can mark the website or url you are focussing on and any distracting websites you come across. After that anytime you open a link to a distracting website, the plugin will automatically redirect you to the site you need to be focussing on.

To have the most success in staying focussed, we recommend that you run the extension in incognito mode also.
